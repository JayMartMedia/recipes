# JayMartMedia Recipes

## Site

https://jaymartmedia.github.io/recipes/

## Goals

There are 4 goals of this site:
- Provide a place for me to put recipes so that I can easily find them from any device
- Display recipes without a lot of junk getting in the way (other recipe sites have tons of ads)
- Display amount of ingredients next to the name of the ingredient in the recipe instructions (to prevent having to constantly look between instructions and ingredient list)
- Handle calculations for double/triple/etc. batches easily
